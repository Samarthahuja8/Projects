      "aboutStateCultivation": "The state has 5.71 million ha of cultivated area, of which 3.43 million ha (61%) has assured irrigation. The soils are deep alluvial, but suffer due to salinity/alkalinity and nutrient deficiencies of sulphur, boron and zinc. Occasional flooding and imperfect drainage affect crop growth. Rice, wheat and winter maize are predominant crops of the state. The productivity of different crops in the state is less than the national average."
